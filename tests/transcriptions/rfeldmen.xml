<p t="12976" d="3364">- So, this was supposed to be replaced</p>
<p t="16340" d="1870">by the title of the talk.</p>
<p t="18210" d="1420">I never came up with the title.</p>
<p t="19630" d="1490">And then I thought,</p>
<p t="21120" d="1410">&quot;Actually, FIXME is a
good title for this talk.&quot;</p>
<p t="22530" d="833">So, FIXME this.</p>
<p t="25953" d="4857">As Evan just said, I&#39;ve
been doing this for a while.</p>
<p t="30810" d="3913">In fact, I&#39;ve been doing
information systems,</p>
<p t="35870" d="5000">being involved in that world,
for 20 years, or thereabouts.</p>
<p t="41060" d="3590">Which is a really weird
thing for me to say because</p>
<p t="44650" d="3150">when I got started I
was about 20 years old.</p>
<p t="47800" d="4270">And this concept of being
involved in an industry</p>
<p t="52070" d="4223">for two decades just seemed foreign.</p>
<p t="57300" d="2980">Now I&#39;ve been around
for about two decades,</p>
<p t="60280" d="3790">and in some ways, things are no different.</p>
<p t="64070" d="5000">I have the same fire to fix the future.</p>
<p t="70320" d="5000">But instead of having that
fueled in some ways by</p>
<p t="75470" d="2470">sort of youthful ignorance,</p>
<p t="77940" d="2522">which I think is a very valuable thing,</p>
<p t="80462" d="4228">and one of the things I do
miss from the past is that,</p>
<p t="84690" d="2490">that ignorance, that bliss.</p>
<p t="87180" d="3190">I have something else instead,
which is a sense of history.</p>
<p t="90370" d="4990">And that sense of history is
both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p t="95360" d="3210">In some ways it&#39;s an
easy trap to fall into</p>
<p t="98570" d="4210">to just reminisce, and be
content with what we did,</p>
<p t="102780" d="2180">and where we were.</p>
<p t="104960" d="1450">In another way it&#39;s a blessing</p>
<p t="106410" d="2093">because it gives you a sense of scale.</p>
<p t="109720" d="2590">The technology industry seems</p>
<p t="112310" d="2163">like it moves so incredibly quickly.</p>
<p t="115350" d="2040">Not a week goes by, and
something new is announced,</p>
<p t="117390" d="1657">and you think, &quot;Oh man, everything I knew</p>
<p t="119047" d="3393">&quot;is all of a sudden old or outdated,&quot;</p>
<p t="122440" d="3150">when really, the broad
strokes, the tectonic plates,</p>
<p t="125590" d="2013">they don&#39;t move all that fast.</p>
<p t="130080" d="2730">If you think about the main technology</p>
<p t="132810" d="2050">that underpins a lot of the applications</p>
<p t="134860" d="2560">that people in this
room, and that I work on</p>
<p t="137420" d="1493">is the relational database.</p>
<p t="139770" d="3100">It&#39;s basically been
around in its current form</p>
<p t="142870" d="2185">for I don&#39;t know how long.</p>
<p t="145055" d="833">More than the 20 years that I--</p>
<p t="145888" d="1610">I should have looked that up.</p>
<p t="147498" d="1245">I would have started,</p>
<p t="148743" d="3457">&quot;The relational database
was invented in 1954.&quot;</p>
<p t="152200" d="1190">But I don&#39;t actually know.</p>
<p t="153390" d="2870">So anyway, it&#39;s been
around for a long time,</p>
<p t="156260" d="3110">and it&#39;s still at the
core of our applications,</p>
<p t="159370" d="1190">a lot of applications.</p>
<p t="160560" d="2640">We&#39;ve had other forms of storage come,</p>
<p t="163200" d="4240">and in many senses go,
and things have changed,</p>
<p t="167440" d="4330">but in an industry that
supposedly moves so quickly</p>
<p t="171770" d="3010">it&#39;s still interesting to
think about the fact that</p>
<p t="174780" d="2250">one of those core pieces
has been around for so long.</p>
<p t="177030" d="3003">Ruby itself has been
around for 25 years now.</p>
<p t="183170" d="1740">But in that time, things
have still changed.</p>
<p t="184910" d="2220">Even if some of the things stay the same,</p>
<p t="187130" d="2100">some things do change.</p>
<p t="189230" d="4020">One of the things that have
changed since I started</p>
<p t="193250" d="3400">is this notion of the DBA,
the database administrator.</p>
<p t="196650" d="2630">The person whose job it is</p>
<p t="199280" d="3910">to guard this precious data store</p>
<p t="203190" d="2943">from the savages, application developers.</p>
<p t="208620" d="3860">This guardian role, when I got
started about 20 years ago,</p>
<p t="212480" d="950">was pretty common.</p>
<p t="213430" d="3750">You didn&#39;t have to be that big of a team</p>
<p t="217180" d="3090">before you had someone whose job</p>
<p t="220270" d="2688">was to defend the database.</p>
<p t="222958" d="3822">Now I&#39;d be surprised if
most people in this room</p>
<p t="226780" d="3453">are on teams that have a full-time DBA.</p>
<p t="231940" d="1253">Why did that change?</p>
<p t="234210" d="3630">What happened to the relational
database and to our industry</p>
<p t="237840" d="4330">such that we no longer needed,
in most teams, the DBA?</p>
<p t="242170" d="4390">It&#39;s not that this role
is entirely extinct.</p>
<p t="246560" d="1690">It&#39;s just exotic.</p>
<p t="248250" d="2800">You have to go to exotic
places and exotic companies,</p>
<p t="251050" d="2420">very large institutions,
before you find this again.</p>
<p t="253470" d="2510">It&#39;s not sort of commonplace in</p>
<p t="255980" d="1360">small to medium sized businesses.</p>
<p t="257340" d="1450">What happened?</p>
<p t="258790" d="2590">So some of what happened was</p>
<p t="261380" d="4670">advances just in the underlying hardware.</p>
<p t="266050" d="3430">One of the reasons we had
DBAs were to make sure</p>
<p t="269480" d="2820">that the relational
database stayed performant.</p>
<p t="272300" d="3800">Now the ceiling for what a database can do</p>
<p t="276100" d="3290">without having someone
who&#39;s a trained professional</p>
<p t="279390" d="3210">tinker with it all day, is so much higher.</p>
<p t="282600" d="3730">We&#39;ve raised the ceiling
through technological progress</p>
<p t="286330" d="3000">in such a way we don&#39;t
have to spend all day</p>
<p t="289330" d="2610">having someone just tweak the dials</p>
<p t="291940" d="3163">in such a way that it won&#39;t fall over.</p>
<p t="296320" d="4550">In fact, at Basecamp, where I work,</p>
<p t="300870" d="2033">we have a relatively large database.</p>
<p t="303890" d="2440">We&#39;ve manage to launch
all sorts of features</p>
<p t="306330" d="3300">with the wrong indexes,
to tens of thousands,</p>
<p t="309630" d="1610">if not hundreds of thousands of people,</p>
<p t="311240" d="3020">and not realize it until it fell over</p>
<p t="314260" d="1653">like three months later.</p>
<p t="317380" d="3033">That is progress.
(laughter)</p>
<p t="321830" d="5000">There is progress in how long
we&#39;re allowed to stay ignorant</p>
<p t="327270" d="3830">about the underlying fundamentals
of technology that we use.</p>
<p t="331100" d="2210">And I mean that seriously and not glibly,</p>
<p t="333310" d="2240">that that is actually progress.</p>
<p t="335550" d="4220">The fact that we can
push out considerations</p>
<p t="339770" d="2180">that before had to be made up front</p>
<p t="341950" d="3990">and very early in the process
is a huge step forward.</p>
<p t="345940" d="3030">But the role of the DBA, I&#39;d say,</p>
<p t="348970" d="3700">is classical creative destruction.</p>
<p t="352670" d="3770">We used to have this role in
our industry that employed,</p>
<p t="356440" d="2320">as a percentage of people
who were in the industry,</p>
<p t="358760" d="990">a fair number of people.</p>
<p t="359750" d="1793">And today, we don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="362552" d="4738">It&#39;s kind of gone away to some notion.</p>
<p t="367290" d="3893">And it&#39;s not just the role.
It&#39;s not just the DBA.</p>
<p t="372330" d="2040">It&#39;s also a bunch of techniques</p>
<p t="374370" d="2420">that revolve around this
relational database,</p>
<p t="376790" d="2880">this core of our applications.</p>
<p t="379670" d="3923">One of those techniques is
a technique call sharding.</p>
<p t="383593" d="2477">Sharding is this concept where,</p>
<p t="386070" d="2090">when you reach a certain tipping point</p>
<p t="388160" d="1160">in how much data you store,</p>
<p t="389320" d="1970">and how many people are
accessing that data,</p>
<p t="391290" d="2779">you start splitting up
your single database</p>
<p t="394069" d="1151">into multiple databases such that</p>
<p t="395220" d="3632">customers one to 10,000
goes to this database,</p>
<p t="398852" d="2848">and 10,000 through 20,000
go to this database.</p>
<p t="401700" d="3913">And that adds a fair amount of complexity.</p>
<p t="406460" d="2300">Before you had one database
and you had to worry about</p>
<p t="408760" d="2980">migrating one database,
operating one database,</p>
<p t="411740" d="2010">accessing one database.</p>
<p t="413750" d="1520">Then you shard your database,</p>
<p t="415270" d="3093">and all of a sudden you
have that problem times 10.</p>
<p t="420290" d="5000">Now, sharding came into my
world around 2007 or so.</p>
<p t="430810" d="4410">We were at Basecamp just
getting towards the ceiling</p>
<p t="435220" d="2380">of what we could do
with a single database.</p>
<p t="437600" d="2610">And we started doing our
projections and we could see,</p>
<p t="440210" d="3219">oh, we are sort of getting
so and so much new data</p>
<p t="443429" d="3191">every month, in x amount of months,</p>
<p t="446620" d="1610">we&#39;re gonna hit the ceiling here.</p>
<p t="448230" d="4650">We&#39;ll run out of cache
storage for the database.</p>
<p t="452880" d="3360">If we&#39;re gonna have to
hit these spinning disks,</p>
<p t="456240" d="1883">then we&#39;re gonna be in trouble.</p>
<p t="458960" d="1190">It&#39;s actually funny.</p>
<p t="460150" d="1710">Mark Imbriaco, who is speaking</p>
<p t="461860" d="1820">at the end of day of the keynote,</p>
<p t="463680" d="1760">was, I believe, at the time</p>
<p t="465440" d="3550">the sole system administrator at Basecamp.</p>
<p t="468990" d="857">And we were talking about this,</p>
<p t="469847" d="3910">&quot;Oh, we really need to put
time aside to do sharding.</p>
<p t="473757" d="2420">&quot;We need to figure out
the techniques to do it.</p>
<p t="476177" d="2494">&quot;We need to set it up. We
need to block away time.&quot;</p>
<p t="478671" d="2976">We&#39;re like, &quot;This sounds like
it&#39;s gonna be a long process.</p>
<p t="481647" d="1450">&quot;It&#39;s gonna be a long project.</p>
<p t="483097" d="1290">&quot;Are we gonna take this three months,</p>
<p t="484387" d="2000">&quot;or whatever it&#39;s going to be to do it?&quot;</p>
<p t="487678" d="4622">And I sort of treated this
with the same approach</p>
<p t="492300" d="1650">that I treat a lot of things:</p>
<p t="493950" d="1700">eh, let&#39;s worry about it tomorrow.</p>
<p t="497070" d="3540">And tomorrow came, right?</p>
<p t="500610" d="1647">And we were like, &quot;Oh, we
got a little closer to limit.</p>
<p t="502257" d="1950">&quot;But yeah, you know what?</p>
<p t="504207" d="2203">&quot;These boxes that we have at...&quot;</p>
<p t="506410" d="1750">I forget the history specifically.</p>
<p t="508160" d="970">Maybe it was at Rackspace.</p>
<p t="509130" d="2000">Or Rackspace now has an option</p>
<p t="511130" d="1370">that we can get some more RAM,</p>
<p t="512500" d="1930">so we can extend our cache storage</p>
<p t="514430" d="2963">and we get a little more time.</p>
<p t="519010" d="1920">But, I mean, we&#39;re still
gonna need to do it.</p>
<p t="520930" d="2710">Like, for sure, there&#39;s
no way that we can wait</p>
<p t="523640" d="2050">more than at least another year.</p>
<p t="525690" d="1850">All right, so then the
other year comes around,</p>
<p t="527540" d="3540">and again, we got bailed
out by technology.</p>
<p t="531080" d="4460">I think the big bailout came
when SSDs became a thing,</p>
<p t="535540" d="2460">like when we were no longer
spinning disks around</p>
<p t="538000" d="2400">and all of a sudden
the ceiling just jumped</p>
<p t="540400" d="1163">an order of magnitude.</p>
<p t="543040" d="4393">To this day, all versions of
Basecamp have avoided sharding.</p>
<p t="548350" d="2340">We don&#39;t shard any of our applications.</p>
<p t="550690" d="3860">All of our applications
have one main database</p>
<p t="554550" d="960">that&#39;s being written to.</p>
<p t="555510" d="3070">Then we have some replicas
that are being read from,</p>
<p t="558580" d="2270">but that doesn&#39;t really
have any material complexity</p>
<p t="560850" d="1613">compared to sharding,</p>
<p t="563540" d="2390">and splitting things up
into separate databases.</p>
<p t="565930" d="4700">We were able to wait it out,</p>
<p t="570630" d="3740">let creative destruction,
and technological progress,</p>
<p t="574370" d="5000">and software progress,
take a whole problem,</p>
<p t="579550" d="1960">and basically, we don&#39;t need to do that.</p>
<p t="581510" d="3603">Oh, by the way, we don&#39;t employ
at DBAs at Basecamp either.</p>
<p t="586593" d="5000">Here&#39;s a human side of it,
and a pattern side of it,</p>
<p t="591925" d="4095">that we no longer need
to deal with at all.</p>
<p t="596020" d="1810">That&#39;s real progress.</p>
<p t="597830" d="2120">We&#39;re still dealing with
the relational database,</p>
<p t="599950" d="2660">but we&#39;ve taken these facets of it</p>
<p t="602610" d="1950">that used to be absolutely givens,</p>
<p t="604560" d="2820">that once you reached a certain
size you had to have a DBA,</p>
<p t="607380" d="1750">and you had to do things like sharding,</p>
<p t="609130" d="1850">and we don&#39;t need to do that anymore.</p>
<p t="612270" d="3750">Now, that progress, when
you look back at it now</p>
<p t="616020" d="2480">over the course of 20
years seems just obvious.</p>
<p t="618500" d="1323">Like, of course.</p>
<p t="620746" d="2704">And it&#39;s a little easier
in these two cases,</p>
<p t="623450" d="2680">although I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll
find people who will</p>
<p t="626130" d="3630">staunchly advocate for both
getting ready for sharding</p>
<p t="629760" d="1450">and getting ready for hiring a DBA.</p>
<p t="631210" d="2944">And at some point you do
need to do these things.</p>
<p t="634154" d="5000">I&#39;m sure GitHub, or other
large scale applications</p>
<p t="639490" d="2710">that reach close to the
internet scale or thereabout,</p>
<p t="642200" d="1390">of course you need to do sharding.</p>
<p t="643590" d="2310">But it&#39;s become an exotic technique,</p>
<p t="645900" d="3560">just like the DBA has become
a bit of an exotic role.</p>
<p t="649460" d="2921">Now, some of this progress doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p t="652381" d="2959">as smoothly or as cleanly as in just,</p>
<p t="655340" d="2223">oh, we stopped doing these things.</p>
<p t="660747" d="4196">When I first started
working on Active Record,</p>
<p t="666513" d="2450">ORMs were controversial.</p>
<p t="670400" d="2410">There were actually real
debates about whether</p>
<p t="672810" d="3170">it was a good idea to wrap
the relational database</p>
<p t="675980" d="4080">in an object interface,
because you know what,</p>
<p t="680060" d="3460">how can your API, how can
something like Active Record</p>
<p t="683520" d="4477">be as performant, or as efficient,</p>
<p t="689070" d="2960">as handwritten SQL statements?</p>
<p t="692030" d="1770">We debated these things.</p>
<p t="693800" d="833">And there were a lot of people like,</p>
<p t="694633" d="2807">&quot;I&#39;m never gonna use that ORM.&quot;</p>
<p t="697440" d="4387">Like, &quot;You&#39;re just lazy if
you don&#39;t write your own SQL.</p>
<p t="701827" d="2290">&quot;And by the way, you&#39;re
gonna hit all these problems,</p>
<p t="704117" d="4643">&quot;and you&#39;re gonna hit all
these issues if you do that.&quot;</p>
<p t="708760" d="5000">Like, imagine all the queries
that ORM untuned can kick off.</p>
<p t="714800" d="833">And it can.</p>
<p t="716890" d="2650">I know that because the
vast majority of pages,</p>
<p t="719540" d="2530">again, at Basecamp, are untuned.</p>
<p t="722070" d="3050">I&#39;ve recently done a couple
of performance dives,</p>
<p t="725120" d="2280">and when I look at the
number of SQL queries</p>
<p t="727400" d="1920">that Active Record will kick off</p>
<p t="729320" d="4103">on a single page in Basecamp
it&#39;s sometimes hundreds.</p>
<p t="735190" d="4540">If you told that to
people 10, 15 years ago,</p>
<p t="739730" d="1450">that like, oh, we&#39;d just be kicking off,</p>
<p t="741180" d="2140">willy nilly, hundreds of SQL queries</p>
<p t="743320" d="2280">on a single page for a single user,</p>
<p t="745600" d="1317">they&#39;d be like, &quot;You&#39;re out of your mind.</p>
<p t="746917" d="2480">&quot;There&#39;s no way you
can make that perform.&quot;</p>
<p t="751730" d="833">But we did.</p>
<p t="753460" d="4140">Progress both in terms of
technology and in terms of the API</p>
<p t="758680" d="3590">allowed it to move to a higher level.</p>
<p t="762270" d="2610">That higher level was one
where we no longer needed</p>
<p t="764880" d="5000">to deal most of the time,
most of our days, with SQL,</p>
<p t="770100" d="2140">even though, again,
the relational database</p>
<p t="772240" d="2590">is absolutely at the core of what we do.</p>
<p t="774830" d="2130">Now there&#39;s a pattern there,</p>
<p t="776960" d="1800">that even though something remains</p>
<p t="778760" d="960">at the core of what we do,</p>
<p t="779720" d="3560">and even though at times
we do need to dive into it,</p>
<p t="783280" d="2820">and there will be use cases
where we need sort of the</p>
<p t="787140" d="3583">past exotica of techniques,
and people, and roles,</p>
<p t="791725" d="1565">most of the time we don&#39;t
need to worry about it.</p>
<p t="793290" d="2470">In much the same way that like, hey,</p>
<p t="795760" d="3830">the CPU is at the core
of a lot of what we do.</p>
<p t="799590" d="2350">We don&#39;t need to worry
about assembler anymore.</p>
<p t="802933" d="3417">We don&#39;t need to worry about things like</p>
<p t="806350" d="3030">garbage collection, most of the time.</p>
<p t="809380" d="1530">It used to be a huge thing</p>
<p t="810910" d="2077">that people worried
intensely about all the time.</p>
<p t="812987" d="3010">&quot;There&#39;s no way a garbage
collector can be efficient enough</p>
<p t="815997" d="4430">&quot;for us to be able to fit our system</p>
<p t="820427" d="1223">&quot;into the memory that we have.&quot;</p>
<p t="821650" d="2320">And now, in the Ruby community,</p>
<p t="823970" d="1840">the only person who has to
worry about garbage collection,</p>
<p t="825810" d="3350">is pretty much Aaron, and
the rest of Ruby Core.</p>
<p t="829160" d="1540">That&#39;s real progress.</p>
<p t="830700" d="2833">We&#39;ve taken all our problems
and given them to Aaron.</p>
<p t="839927" d="4233">And now if our Rails
program uses to much memory</p>
<p t="844160" d="3717">we can just shout, &quot;Aaron! Fix it!&quot;</p>
<p t="849210" d="2400">That&#39;s great. Right?</p>
<p t="851610" d="1280">That&#39;s real progress,</p>
<p t="852890" d="3230">that we can just always
be blaming one person,</p>
<p t="856120" d="3673">and we no longer need to really
learn these fundamentals.</p>
<p t="861460" d="2880">And that&#39;s what I love about
that word fundamentals,</p>
<p t="864340" d="2474">because usually programmers,</p>
<p t="866814" d="833">when they speak about fundamentals,</p>
<p t="867647" d="1620">they speak in these tones about,</p>
<p t="869267" d="3273">&quot;Everyone should really
learn the fundamentals.&quot;</p>
<p t="872540" d="2730">There&#39;s a lot of fundamentals
in software development</p>
<p t="875270" d="2130">that no one learns anymore.</p>
<p t="877400" d="2530">No one who just works
on information systems</p>
<p t="879930" d="2990">need to know the intricacies
of how a CPU works.</p>
<p t="882920" d="1820">They might, still, if they want to,</p>
<p t="884740" d="2580">or they might end up in a specialized role</p>
<p t="887320" d="1113">where they need to.</p>
<p t="891090" d="3600">And we&#39;re getting to that
point with other things.</p>
<p t="894690" d="2330">No SQL used to mean</p>
<p t="897020" d="3710">that people were using a
non-relational database,</p>
<p t="900730" d="1300">and losing all their data.</p>
<p t="903256" d="5000">Now No SQL really means you get
to use a relational database</p>
<p t="909690" d="1373">without writing any SQL.</p>
<p t="912160" d="2110">I&#39;d be surprised if
most people in this room</p>
<p t="914270" d="4503">write SQL, fully-formed SQL
statements, on a daily basis.</p>
<p t="921240" d="1740">We just don&#39;t do that anymore.</p>
<p t="922980" d="2470">When I got started, again, 20 years ago,</p>
<p t="925450" d="3470">I would write fully-formed SQL statements</p>
<p t="928920" d="2490">at the top of my PHP script</p>
<p t="931410" d="2140">and I would embed the parameters</p>
<p t="933550" d="2293">straight from the web request.</p>
<p t="938296" d="1800">Thankfully we don&#39;t do that anymore.</p>
<p t="941940" d="4000">And generally speaking, we
don&#39;t need to write SQL anymore.</p>
<p t="945940" d="1580">It&#39;s not that we&#39;re not using it,</p>
<p t="947520" d="2830">just in the same way we
continue to use assembler.</p>
<p t="950350" d="3082">It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t see
it and we don&#39;t write it.</p>
<p t="953432" d="2378">In some ways we&#39;ve moved
so far up the chain</p>
<p t="955810" d="4220">that SQL to some extent,
and in some capacity,</p>
<p t="960030" d="2190">is like a form of assembler.</p>
<p t="962220" d="1540">It&#39;s a low-level language that</p>
<p t="963760" d="3140">we occasionally need to dig into,</p>
<p t="966900" d="3560">but most of the time we
can just blissfully ignore</p>
<p t="970460" d="2190">and be all the better for it.</p>
<p t="972650" d="2880">In fact, I just, as I was
putting these slides together,</p>
<p t="975530" d="2173">looked through the Basecamp 3 code base,</p>
<p t="978950" d="3430">which is a relatively large code base.</p>
<p t="982380" d="4730">Hundreds of screens, and
multiple hundreds of models.</p>
<p t="987110" d="3980">We do not have a single
fully-formed SQL statement</p>
<p t="991090" d="1353">in any of that code.</p>
<p t="993920" d="833">We used to.</p>
<p t="994753" d="2827">When we made the first
versions of Active Record</p>
<p t="997580" d="2590">we still sort of had a
preliminary early stage,</p>
<p t="1000170" d="3040">and we still occasionally
need to dig down,</p>
<p t="1003210" d="1420">and now we don&#39;t anymore.</p>
<p t="1004630" d="2170">This is one of those things
that just become apparent</p>
<p t="1006800" d="2630">when you look over the arc
of something like 20 years.</p>
<p t="1009430" d="3950">Like, oh yeah, we used
to do all these things,</p>
<p t="1013380" d="2400">and now we don&#39;t do them anymore.</p>
<p t="1015780" d="3130">Now, some of that, as I
said, comes automatically,</p>
<p t="1018910" d="1260">it comes for free.</p>
<p t="1020170" d="4650">It comes because we get
SSDs, we get cheap RAM,</p>
<p t="1024820" d="2490">we get faster CPUs, we get all this stuff</p>
<p t="1027310" d="2910">that just sort of shows up,
and makes our lives easier.</p>
<p t="1030220" d="2100">And all of a sudden
there&#39;s this tipping point</p>
<p t="1032320" d="1720">that we may not even notice</p>
<p t="1034040" d="3350">wherein certain things are
just no longer necessary.</p>
<p t="1037390" d="950">The other part of this,</p>
<p t="1038340" d="2290">which is the part that
I&#39;m really interested in,</p>
<p t="1040630" d="2680">is the part that I
actually have an impact on,</p>
<p t="1043310" d="5000">and that we have an impact
on, is conceptual compression.</p>
<p t="1050060" d="4700">This idea that we have
a multitude of concepts</p>
<p t="1054760" d="2980">that we need to worry about, entangle,</p>
<p t="1057740" d="2870">and juggle as we&#39;re making applications.</p>
<p t="1060610" d="1920">And at certain periods and times,</p>
<p t="1062530" d="3382">certain concepts loomed very large.</p>
<p t="1065912" d="1818">SQL used to loom very large,</p>
<p t="1067730" d="2940">and you had to really study your SQL,</p>
<p t="1070670" d="3770">and figure out how to write
it, and have that top of mind</p>
<p t="1074440" d="1710">to be able to make applications.</p>
<p t="1076150" d="1663">Today, again, if you ask me,</p>
<p t="1078655" d="1945">can you write a fully
formed insert statement</p>
<p t="1080600" d="2760">on the spot right now on the blackboard?</p>
<p t="1083360" d="1986">I&#39;d probably get it wrong.</p>
<p t="1085346" d="1854">I&#39;d forget where the parentheses went.</p>
<p t="1087200" d="2590">And that&#39;s not even to
speak about join statements</p>
<p t="1089790" d="4820">or any of the more sort of
complicated usages of SQL.</p>
<p t="1094610" d="1960">It&#39;s just not something
that&#39;s top of mind anymore.</p>
<p t="1096570" d="3630">I used to. I used to write
that stuff all the time.</p>
<p t="1100200" d="3200">And then through progress,</p>
<p t="1103400" d="2580">through ORMs, through Active Record,</p>
<p t="1105980" d="2680">we&#39;ve managed to compress that concept</p>
<p t="1108660" d="3230">into something that&#39;s
maybe a 10th, or a 100th,</p>
<p t="1111890" d="2413">of the size that it used to be.</p>
<p t="1115450" d="4050">Now, conceptual compression, I think,</p>
<p t="1119500" d="2550">is probably the most important thing</p>
<p t="1122050" d="2403">that we&#39;re doing in the Rails development.</p>
<p t="1125620" d="1670">It&#39;s the most important thing for me</p>
<p t="1127290" d="2440">as I think through what should I work on,</p>
<p t="1129730" d="1550">and how should we progress,</p>
<p t="1131280" d="2540">because there are all these concepts.</p>
<p t="1133820" d="2920">And I&#39;ll talk about how, in some ways,</p>
<p t="1136740" d="2540">we&#39;re losing the battle
on this compression front.</p>
<p t="1139280" d="3140">And there are more and more
concepts that are being</p>
<p t="1142420" d="3660">forced upon us, that if
we don&#39;t compress the ones</p>
<p t="1146080" d="2720">we&#39;re getting a greater and
deeper understanding of,</p>
<p t="1148800" d="2700">we just won&#39;t have room in our head</p>
<p t="1151500" d="2000">for the new ones we need to worry about.</p>
<p t="1155560" d="3180">Now, up until this point I think</p>
<p t="1158740" d="2630">it sounds not controversial.</p>
<p t="1161370" d="4490">Like, we all want to compress
concepts, at least in theory.</p>
<p t="1165860" d="2710">But I think in practice it&#39;s different.</p>
<p t="1168570" d="1750">I think one of the reasons it&#39;s different</p>
<p t="1170320" d="2480">is because a lot of programmers</p>
<p t="1172800" d="1893">like to play with LEGOs.</p>
<p t="1175840" d="2880">And I like to play with LEGOs.</p>
<p t="1178720" d="1750">I mean, that&#39;s not
really saying that much,</p>
<p t="1180470" d="2410">because I&#39;m pretty much
nationally obligated</p>
<p t="1182880" d="1713">as a Dane to like LEGOs.</p>
<p t="1186730" d="2160">But nonetheless, I like
playing with LEGOs.</p>
<p t="1188890" d="2080">It&#39;s fun to put things together.</p>
<p t="1190970" d="3600">It&#39;s fun to build things from scratch.</p>
<p t="1194570" d="3963">It&#39;s fun to build things
from individual small pieces.</p>
<p t="1199750" d="2330">The problem, I think, comes in is</p>
<p t="1202080" d="3930">once you get used to a
certain size of blocks.</p>
<p t="1206010" d="3220">We have this 2x8 here,</p>
<p t="1209230" d="3703">like this is the size of the
block I start putting together.</p>
<p t="1214255" d="1755">You kind of start thinking
like that is your world,</p>
<p t="1216010" d="1920">like this is a choice that I&#39;m making</p>
<p t="1217930" d="2380">about the size of the block
that I&#39;m putting together,</p>
<p t="1220310" d="1860">and that&#39;s really important, because hey,</p>
<p t="1222170" d="2120">this is what I used to
be doing all the time,</p>
<p t="1224290" d="1080">so of course it&#39;s important,</p>
<p t="1225370" d="1550">because what I do is important.</p>
<p t="1228690" d="3170">Now, sometimes the size
of the block changes.</p>
<p t="1231860" d="2462">And a lot of people will be like,</p>
<p t="1234322" d="1388">&quot;No, no, no, no. That&#39;s too coarsely.&quot;</p>
<p t="1235710" d="3623">Like, &quot;That&#39;s a toy.&quot; Like, &quot;That&#39;s Duplo.</p>
<p t="1240637" d="1630">&quot;Duplo is for fucking kids.</p>
<p t="1242267" d="3056">&quot;I&#39;m an adult. I play
with goddamned LEGOs.</p>
<p t="1247867" d="1763">&quot;I like the size of my blocks.&quot;</p>
<p t="1249630" d="3110">And I think that that&#39;s what
we went through with ORMs,</p>
<p t="1254300" d="2510">controversy, with the idea that like</p>
<p t="1256810" d="3590">you should be handwriting
your SQL most of the time.</p>
<p t="1260400" d="2600">If you were used to writing
your SQL most of the time</p>
<p t="1263000" d="1710">you went like, &quot;What the fuck?&quot;</p>
<p t="1264710" d="1847">Like, &quot;Now you&#39;re telling
me that I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p t="1266557" d="3050">&quot;be putting these blocks
together individually anymore.</p>
<p t="1269607" d="1950">&quot;That&#39;s just wrong, because you know what?</p>
<p t="1271557" d="2730">&quot;I can build anything with my blocks.</p>
<p t="1274287" d="2770">&quot;I can build the goddamn
Millennium Falcon with my blocks,</p>
<p t="1277057" d="1930">&quot;and look at that.</p>
<p t="1278987" d="1283">&quot;Isn&#39;t that cool?&quot;</p>
<p t="1280270" d="3060">Yeah, it&#39;s cool. You&#39;re
building things with blocks.</p>
<p t="1283330" d="2562">I mean, I appreciate the sort of</p>
<p t="1285892" d="2778">memory that goes into that,</p>
<p t="1288670" d="2840">and the dexterity that goes into that.</p>
<p t="1291510" d="3410">But if we all just want
the Millennium Falcon,</p>
<p t="1294920" d="2200">why are we all fucking
building it from scratch?</p>
<p t="1297120" d="2323">You can buy that shit on Amazon.</p>
<p t="1300424" d="2186">(laughter)
Pre-assembled!</p>
<p t="1302610" d="2550">And like, look at the fidelity there.</p>
<p t="1305160" d="3680">Like, what crude imitation of
the Millennium Falcon is that</p>
<p t="1308840" d="1160">compared to that?</p>
<p t="1310000" d="2410">That actually kind of
looks like the same thing.</p>
<p t="1312410" d="2630">But we sort of get lulled into the belief</p>
<p t="1315040" d="2230">that unless I build it myself,</p>
<p t="1317270" d="3230">it&#39;s really not as brittle, and as ugly,</p>
<p t="1320500" d="2180">and whatever, as this thing.</p>
<p t="1322680" d="4440">We have this sense of
innate ownership, I think,</p>
<p t="1327120" d="2060">that comes in from when we build something</p>
<p t="1329180" d="2630">from the small pieces.</p>
<p t="1331810" d="3190">But it&#39;s not that helpful,</p>
<p t="1335000" d="2023">and we&#39;re doing it self-indulgently.</p>
<p t="1338000" d="4210">You&#39;re not building the
Millennium Falcon out of LEGOs</p>
<p t="1342210" d="2840">because you get a better
Millennium Falcon.</p>
<p t="1345050" d="3860">It&#39;s a little bit like
what we used to call</p>
<p t="1348910" d="2620">this home rolled framework.</p>
<p t="1351530" d="1560">You can get something that kind of works</p>
<p t="1353090" d="1250">and is fun to play with.</p>
<p t="1354340" d="2990">But like hey, if you just put
industrial processes together</p>
<p t="1357330" d="4840">and build on top of decades
of production techniques</p>
<p t="1362170" d="2580">honed by people, you will
get a better product.</p>
<p t="1364750" d="2610">And I think that that&#39;s
sort of the hard part.</p>
<p t="1367360" d="3510">That&#39;s why this notion
of conceptual compression</p>
<p t="1370870" d="3000">sounds appealing when you
talk about it in the abstract,</p>
<p t="1373870" d="4720">but as soon as you start
applying it to real concepts,</p>
<p t="1378590" d="3480">concepts that you used to
worry about all the time,</p>
<p t="1382070" d="1583">it gets a lot more dicey.</p>
<p t="1385096" d="1777">But yet we must.</p>
<p t="1388960" d="4050">If you look at the
history of Ruby on Rails,</p>
<p t="1393010" d="2830">it&#39;s been around for about 15 years now,</p>
<p t="1395840" d="4730">and over that arc, when
I&#39;m looking back at it</p>
<p t="1400570" d="2120">in my rose-colored glasses,</p>
<p t="1402690" d="1930">I like to think that what we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p t="1404620" d="2490">is a lot of this conceptual compression.</p>
<p t="1407110" d="1560">We&#39;ve taken a lot of concepts</p>
<p t="1408670" d="1740">that people used to worry about</p>
<p t="1410410" d="3150">and have to figure out
from first principles</p>
<p t="1413560" d="2040">and then we&#39;ve turned them into</p>
<p t="1415600" d="1730">something that most people
don&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p t="1417330" d="1540">most of the time.</p>
<p t="1418870" d="5000">And by doing so, we&#39;ve
pushed out the need for</p>
<p t="1424550" d="3510">specialization and sophistication.</p>
<p t="1428060" d="3080">That a single programmer today</p>
<p t="1431140" d="5000">can start sooner, with less knowledge,</p>
<p t="1436140" d="1723">and build better things.</p>
<p t="1440500" d="4070">That is a monumental improvement.</p>
<p t="1444570" d="2640">The fact that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p t="1447210" d="2670">sort of collapse things to a point where</p>
<p t="1449880" d="5000">a generalist can do what a
team used to be required to do</p>
<p t="1456095" d="2065">is real progress.</p>
<p t="1458160" d="2280">Because I think the problem is</p>
<p t="1460440" d="3790">when you push into these
areas of specialization,</p>
<p t="1464230" d="3130">when you get concepts that are so large</p>
<p t="1467360" d="4060">and uncompressed that they
have to occupy the mind</p>
<p t="1471420" d="2747">of a single individual, or
take up a large (mumbling),</p>
<p t="1475530" d="4263">you get too much mind space
to worry about that thing.</p>
<p t="1480700" d="3740">The DBA who used to do
that as a full-time job</p>
<p t="1484440" d="4340">had all day to think
about the risk factors,</p>
<p t="1488780" d="3280">and all the nasty
scenarios that could happen</p>
<p t="1492060" d="3000">if you just let these unwashed programmers</p>
<p t="1495060" d="2133">write their own store procedures.</p>
<p t="1498460" d="3030">All of these factors that
sort of could go wrong,</p>
<p t="1501490" d="1260">they got to worry about that</p>
<p t="1502750" d="1320">and tinker with it all day.</p>
<p t="1504070" d="2783">That&#39;s just too much brain
to apply to one problem.</p>
<p t="1507920" d="3090">And I think we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p t="1511010" d="2460">standing on that balance
with a lot of concepts.</p>
<p t="1513470" d="2100">That the concepts seem like,</p>
<p t="1515570" d="2320">well this is really a whole thing.</p>
<p t="1517890" d="4780">We need to make this a
person&#39;s job to do this thing.</p>
<p t="1522670" d="1940">Rather than being, yeah,</p>
<p t="1524610" d="2640">right now this concept is quite large</p>
<p t="1527250" d="2650">and it will occupy most of
the brain space of someone.</p>
<p t="1529900" d="3000">But if we compress it, it won&#39;t.</p>
<p t="1532900" d="2560">We could fit it in alongside</p>
<p t="1535460" d="2823">all of the other concepts
that we need to do.</p>
<p t="1539210" d="2140">And that that&#39;s a better model.</p>
<p t="1541350" d="4140">That it&#39;s a better model to search for</p>
<p t="1545490" d="3680">ways to compress the concepts
that we need to juggle</p>
<p t="1549170" d="4200">rather than search for
people who can fathom</p>
<p t="1553370" d="1530">the complexity of the problem</p>
<p t="1554900" d="1913">and the concepts that we&#39;re dealing with.</p>
<p t="1558670" d="2290">So when I think about,
as a framework builder,</p>
<p t="1560960" d="1833">what is it that I do,</p>
<p t="1564156" d="2874">and where is it that I
want to spend my time,</p>
<p t="1567030" d="2580">it is to think about it in the sense that</p>
<p t="1569610" d="3230">can we take a concept</p>
<p t="1572840" d="2533">and basically compress it in such a way</p>
<p t="1575373" d="3117">that you can get 80% of
the value of that concept</p>
<p t="1578490" d="2520">in about 20% of the effort, or better.</p>
<p t="1581010" d="1530">Like that&#39;s just one compression rate.</p>
<p t="1582540" d="2500">In many cases we&#39;ve gotten
even better compression rates.</p>
<p t="1585040" d="2890">I&#39;d say the compression
rate around SQL right now</p>
<p t="1587930" d="1260">is like one to 20.</p>
<p t="1589190" d="2760">We spend like 5% of the time on SQL</p>
<p t="1591950" d="1550">that we used to spend on it.</p>
<p t="1593500" d="3060">And that&#39;s real progress.</p>
<p t="1596560" d="3570">Because as I said, the list of things</p>
<p t="1600130" d="3490">you ought to know as a developer</p>
<p t="1603620" d="983">grows all the time.</p>
<p t="1606410" d="2957">That&#39;s some of where the sense of,</p>
<p t="1609367" d="1460">&quot;Oh, shit is moving so fast</p>
<p t="1610827" d="1553">&quot;and I can&#39;t keep up,&quot; comes from.</p>
<p t="1612380" d="1120">Because there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p t="1613500" d="1130">that are constantly popping up</p>
<p t="1614630" d="2440">and mostly in forms of new concepts.</p>
<p t="1617070" d="2343">Oh, all of a sudden I need
to worry about this too now?</p>
<p t="1620430" d="833">Security.</p>
<p t="1622700" d="2250">I think security is far
more at the forefront</p>
<p t="1624950" d="2220">of people&#39;s minds than it was 20 years ago</p>
<p t="1627170" d="4747">when you just string
interpolated query parameters</p>
<p t="1631917" d="2683">string from the request, most of the time,</p>
<p t="1634600" d="2000">and you had all these ways of injection.</p>
<p t="1637796" d="833">And we just didn&#39;t really...</p>
<p t="1638629" d="2051">It was there, the concept was there,</p>
<p t="1640680" d="1220">most people just didn&#39;t focus about it</p>
<p t="1641900" d="2430">because they were so busy
focusing on things like</p>
<p t="1644330" d="2470">how to write a performant SQL query.</p>
<p t="1646800" d="3450">Now when we free up space by compressing</p>
<p t="1650250" d="2870">the existing battery of concepts
that we need to deal with,</p>
<p t="1653120" d="2733">we have this space to
spend on other things.</p>
<p t="1656940" d="920">But yet still,</p>
<p t="1657860" d="2590">the list of things you
ought to know keeps growing.</p>
<p t="1660450" d="2790">And the problem with that is</p>
<p t="1664300" d="2460">it increases the barrier to entry.</p>
<p t="1666760" d="3460">The more shit, the more concepts</p>
<p t="1670220" d="2390">that you&#39;re required to
know before you kind of</p>
<p t="1672610" d="2690">feel like you&#39;re just basically proficient</p>
<p t="1675300" d="3520">in this industry of
building information systems</p>
<p t="1678820" d="4040">and web systems, the harder
it is to get started,</p>
<p t="1682860" d="2780">the fewer people feel
like that&#39;s something</p>
<p t="1685640" d="2110">that they could actually do.</p>
<p t="1687750" d="3150">Again, if I look at the
history of Ruby on Rails,</p>
<p t="1690900" d="3800">the usages of the framework
that I&#39;m most proud of,</p>
<p t="1694700" d="3540">the emails that I get that
makes me smile the most,</p>
<p t="1698240" d="2737">is not some large company that wrote me,</p>
<p t="1700977" d="1570">&quot;Hey, do you know what? We measured this.</p>
<p t="1702547" d="4450">&quot;Rails made us 17.5% more
efficient and productive,</p>
<p t="1706997" d="3153">&quot;and that has really
helped our bottom line.&quot;</p>
<p t="1710150" d="1000">I don&#39;t give a shit.</p>
<p t="1712300" d="2040">I don&#39;t really care about
those forms of progress.</p>
<p t="1714340" d="1717">What I care about is when
I get an email from like,</p>
<p t="1716057" d="2220">&quot;Hey, you know what? I
used to be a musician,</p>
<p t="1718277" d="3220">&quot;and I wanted to create a
website for other musicians</p>
<p t="1721497" d="1580">&quot;to do this, that, and the other thing.</p>
<p t="1723077" d="1290">&quot;I didn&#39;t think I could do this at all.</p>
<p t="1724367" d="1460">&quot;I was not a programmer.</p>
<p t="1725827" d="2850">&quot;Then I read this Rails tutorial.</p>
<p t="1728677" d="1910">&quot;I figured out how to do things.</p>
<p t="1730587" d="1700">&quot;And like, hey, look at my site.</p>
<p t="1732287" d="3940">&quot;There&#39;s like 10,000 musicians
on that now, doing that.&quot;</p>
<p t="1737140" d="2810">You&#39;re like, holy shit,
that is really a change.</p>
<p t="1739950" d="2710">Like if I go back 20 years and think about</p>
<p t="1742660" d="2810">who were the people, who
were the organizations</p>
<p t="1745470" d="3330">that were allowed to
launch information systems,</p>
<p t="1748800" d="2120">and build them, and the process and so on</p>
<p t="1750920" d="2170">that you were required to do.</p>
<p t="1753090" d="1650">Those are not the same people.</p>
<p t="1754740" d="2676">You did not get the amount of stories</p>
<p t="1757416" d="1757">from people like that.</p>
<p t="1760010" d="2750">The advanced bootcamps.</p>
<p t="1762760" d="2040">The fact that you can take someone</p>
<p t="1764800" d="2370">who just has a basic understanding,</p>
<p t="1767170" d="1450">or none at all, about programming.</p>
<p t="1768620" d="2710">And in about three to X amount of months</p>
<p t="1771330" d="3230">you can turn out someone
who&#39;s juniorly proficient</p>
<p t="1774560" d="1400">in what we do.</p>
<p t="1775960" d="2570">That is amazing.</p>
<p t="1778530" d="4130">And that is a real gift that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p t="1782660" d="3150">not treating with the
respect that we should,</p>
<p t="1785810" d="1650">as an industry.</p>
<p t="1787460" d="3070">And the fact that we&#39;ve
managed to compress</p>
<p t="1790530" d="2630">so many of these concepts to the point</p>
<p t="1793160" d="3410">where someone can not
only not need to deal</p>
<p t="1796570" d="1860">with SQL on a daily basis,</p>
<p t="1798430" d="4570">but not even really understand
what SQL is and how it works.</p>
<p t="1803000" d="1890">That&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="1804890" d="3550">That is such fantastic progress.</p>
<p t="1808440" d="1890">Which is funny because,
again, if you think about it</p>
<p t="1810330" d="2710">in the sense of the term fundamentals,</p>
<p t="1813040" d="1767">there would certainly be a lot
of programmers who would say,</p>
<p t="1814807" d="2333">&quot;That is negligent.</p>
<p t="1817140" d="3837">&quot;You are not a serious
developer of information systems</p>
<p t="1820977" d="2340">&quot;if you do not understand the asset test,</p>
<p t="1823317" d="3080">&quot;or any of the other elements
of relational databases.</p>
<p t="1826397" d="2660">&quot;Certainly SQL is just
the bare minimum you need</p>
<p t="1829057" d="4920">&quot;to fully grasp to be allowed
to make applications.&quot;</p>
<p t="1834910" d="877">Fuck off.</p>
<p t="1837720" d="1820">Absolutely not.</p>
<p t="1839540" d="3540">The more we lower the barriers to entry,</p>
<p t="1843080" d="2820">the wider the pool of
people we can attract</p>
<p t="1845900" d="4970">and allow to build applications,
to start on the road.</p>
<p t="1850870" d="1483">How is that not a good thing?</p>
<p t="1855550" d="1140">And I think that there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p t="1856690" d="1920">some insecurities wrapped up into this,</p>
<p t="1858610" d="2680">that if you tie your sense
of self worth as a programmer</p>
<p t="1861290" d="1987">into like, &quot;This is really hard.</p>
<p t="1863277" d="2020">&quot;What I do everyday is really hard,</p>
<p t="1865297" d="3313">&quot;and you have to be so
fucking smart to get this,&quot;</p>
<p t="1868610" d="2100">and then someone who just
goes through a bootcamp</p>
<p t="1870710" d="1660">of three months shows up and does</p>
<p t="1872370" d="2280">sort of kind of the
same thing that you do.</p>
<p t="1874650" d="4140">Then if your ego is sort
of a little fragile,</p>
<p t="1878790" d="1550">maybe that looks like a threat.</p>
<p t="1883180" d="3080">But it&#39;s a good threat.
It&#39;s an expanding threat.</p>
<p t="1886260" d="3360">It&#39;s not like there&#39;s 10,000 applications</p>
<p t="1889620" d="2380">that need to be made every year,</p>
<p t="1892000" d="2770">and those are the applications
that we&#39;re all competing</p>
<p t="1894770" d="2440">to be able to be allowed to work on.</p>
<p t="1897210" d="1120">Absolutely not.</p>
<p t="1898330" d="2120">Most of these people who
are coming into the industry</p>
<p t="1900450" d="3380">are expanding the pie, like
making more new applications.</p>
<p t="1903830" d="2630">The number of new applications, in fact,</p>
<p t="1906460" d="1710">that I&#39;ve talked to the founders of,</p>
<p t="1908170" d="1976">where they basically went like,</p>
<p t="1910146" d="833">&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t know what
the fuck I was doing,</p>
<p t="1910979" d="2008">&quot;but this thing totally took off</p>
<p t="1912987" d="2510">&quot;and all of a sudden we were
getting lots of customers.</p>
<p t="1915497" d="2930">&quot;And then I hired a bunch
of real professionals</p>
<p t="1918427" d="2000">&quot;who kind of knew what they were doing.&quot;</p>
<p t="1921320" d="3550">There&#39;s a lot of those stories.
And those stories are good.</p>
<p t="1924870" d="1800">And that is a way, I think,</p>
<p t="1926670" d="2740">where we&#39;ve sort of helped progress,</p>
<p t="1929410" d="4020">and where compression of concepts take us</p>
<p t="1933430" d="1480">by lowering these barriers,</p>
<p t="1934910" d="3203">by reducing the list of things
you really ought to know</p>
<p t="1938113" d="2987">such that you can get a basic proficiency</p>
<p t="1941100" d="1373">in a three month bootcamp.</p>
<p t="1944270" d="2760">Now, my favorite technique</p>
<p t="1947030" d="2870">to attack this problem</p>
<p t="1949900" d="2990">of reducing the list of
things you ought to know</p>
<p t="1952890" d="2000">is leaky abstractions.</p>
<p t="1954890" d="3040">So, leaky abstractions
was originally coined,</p>
<p t="1957930" d="2370">I believe, as sort of a derogatory term</p>
<p t="1960300" d="3730">against abstractions, and
frameworks, and libraries,</p>
<p t="1964030" d="2910">that did not yet fully
encapsulate and cover</p>
<p t="1966940" d="3553">all the complexity of the
thing that they were wrapping.</p>
<p t="1972100" d="2560">That, for example, the first
version of Active Record</p>
<p t="1974660" d="4010">still required you to write
a substantial amount of SQL.</p>
<p t="1978670" d="1560">You couldn&#39;t just use Active Record</p>
<p t="1980230" d="1870">and expect to get your
whole application done</p>
<p t="1982100" d="1803">if you didn&#39;t know SQL.</p>
<p t="1983903" d="4287">It was sort of one step
up, and one level above,</p>
<p t="1988190" d="1400">but it was quite leaky.</p>
<p t="1989590" d="3160">A lot of times you had to deal
with the underpinnings of it.</p>
<p t="1992750" d="1983">This is how all abstractions start.</p>
<p t="1996100" d="3580">This is why we need to
embrace leaky abstractions,</p>
<p t="1999680" d="2650">not hold onto the fact that no, actually,</p>
<p t="2002330" d="2500">for all eternity, every
programmer in the world</p>
<p t="2004830" d="3400">has to know all the
intricacies of this concept</p>
<p t="2008230" d="1740">because that&#39;s what
makes them professional.</p>
<p t="2009970" d="5000">No. Leaky abstractions is how
we get to solid abstractions.</p>
<p t="2015020" d="2310">If you look at the path of
the history of Active Record</p>
<p t="2017330" d="2540">I think it&#39;s a perfect parallel for that.</p>
<p t="2019870" d="1980">It started out extremely leaky,</p>
<p t="2021850" d="1460">and sort of just a leg up</p>
<p t="2023310" d="2790">of making some things a little easier,</p>
<p t="2026100" d="3430">and it ended up in this
magical place where it is now,</p>
<p t="2029530" d="3383">where people can use it and
not know what the fuck SQL is.</p>
<p t="2034270" d="3380">That is a progression that&#39;s amazing,</p>
<p t="2037650" d="2230">and it came through
this leaky abstraction.</p>
<p t="2039880" d="3940">We need more leaky
abstractions, not fewer,</p>
<p t="2043820" d="2890">because the leaky
abstractions we start today</p>
<p t="2046710" d="3743">are the solid abstractions
of five years from now.</p>
<p t="2051330" d="1980">So unless we start planting these seeds,</p>
<p t="2053310" d="2200">we&#39;re not gonna have
the trees that we want.</p>
<p t="2057870" d="2340">Leaky abstractions, even as they are</p>
<p t="2060210" d="3050">in the initial implementation of them,</p>
<p t="2063260" d="2280">are a form of just-in-time learning.</p>
<p t="2065540" d="1630">JIT learning.</p>
<p t="2067170" d="5000">That maybe as a leaky abstraction
is sort of getting rounded</p>
<p t="2072436" d="3204">there will be these obvious
pitfalls that you fall into,</p>
<p t="2075640" d="1810">and occasionally you will
have to learn something.</p>
<p t="2077450" d="2610">But we get to push that point out further.</p>
<p t="2080060" d="1600">Again, you get to start,</p>
<p t="2081660" d="3090">even with the first
version of Active Record,</p>
<p t="2084750" d="3381">with less that you have to learn.</p>
<p t="2088131" d="1529">The list of things that you
absolutely need to learn</p>
<p t="2089660" d="3810">to make this basic form
work, there&#39;s less of that.</p>
<p t="2093470" d="2970">A lot of the, I find,</p>
<p t="2096440" d="1920">interesting critiques
of something like Rails,</p>
<p t="2098360" d="5000">which has this unending
appetite for leaky abstractions,</p>
<p t="2104370" d="3523">unending appetite for
conceptual compression,</p>
<p t="2109640" d="2660">is that there&#39;s too much of that,</p>
<p t="2112300" d="2630">that there&#39;s too many concepts in Rails,</p>
<p t="2114930" d="1540">that we&#39;ve compressed too many things</p>
<p t="2116470" d="2411">which means that there&#39;s too much code,</p>
<p t="2118881" d="2779">and if you wanted to
understand the entire framework</p>
<p t="2121660" d="3080">and you had to read it
through from start to finish,</p>
<p t="2124740" d="1790">that would take a long time.</p>
<p t="2126530" d="2093">Well, don&#39;t do that.</p>
<p t="2130440" d="1940">Like, who the hell in here understands</p>
<p t="2132380" d="1660">the entire Rails framework?</p>
<p t="2134040" d="1233">I sure as fuck don&#39;t.</p>
<p t="2136470" d="2520">I have not read the entire Rails framework</p>
<p t="2138990" d="1400">in a very long time,</p>
<p t="2140390" d="3950">and there are plenty of
concepts in the Rails framework</p>
<p t="2144340" d="2410">that have been compressed so well</p>
<p t="2146750" d="1990">that I don&#39;t need to
worry about them anymore</p>
<p t="2148740" d="2320">and I put them completely out of mind.</p>
<p t="2151060" d="3330">If you ask me any questions
about the Rails router,</p>
<p t="2154390" d="2533">for example, I just go, I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p t="2158200" d="2100">I know like how the API
is supposed to work.</p>
<p t="2160300" d="1730">I know how I want it to work.</p>
<p t="2162030" d="1690">But how it&#39;s actually implemented?</p>
<p t="2163720" d="2253">Ask Aaron. That&#39;s his problem.</p>
<p t="2170090" d="3320">This is that buffet of
just-in-time learning.</p>
<p t="2173410" d="2400">You don&#39;t need to understand all of Rails.</p>
<p t="2175810" d="4010">Not on your day one, not on year one,</p>
<p t="2179820" d="2190">and not, as in my case, on year 15.</p>
<p t="2183150" d="5000">You can push that out and
reserve the time for learning</p>
<p t="2188230" d="1930">whatever it is that you need to learn</p>
<p t="2190160" d="1950">to the point when you need to learn it.</p>
<p t="2192960" d="2310">When you need to do this specific thing,</p>
<p t="2195270" d="1860">or you&#39;ve hit this problem</p>
<p t="2197130" d="2770">that you want to do better
at, or you want to change,</p>
<p t="2199900" d="2050">or you want to upgrade, or
you simply have to deal with</p>
<p t="2201950" d="2430">because your application
is crashing and too slow,</p>
<p t="2204380" d="1570">that&#39;s the time to learn it.</p>
<p t="2205950" d="1710">It&#39;s a perfect time to learn it.</p>
<p t="2207660" d="2460">If we shove all the learning up front</p>
<p t="2210120" d="1840">then you have to learn all the concepts</p>
<p t="2211960" d="2340">before you&#39;re even allowed to begin,</p>
<p t="2214300" d="2850">that list of things you
ought to know is going to be</p>
<p t="2217150" d="1870">a five year curriculum.</p>
<p t="2219020" d="1920">Who has time for a five year curriculum?</p>
<p t="2220940" d="1980">Why is that even a good thing?</p>
<p t="2222920" d="3360">It&#39;s like memorizing all the states,</p>
<p t="2226280" d="3270">or the capitals of the world.</p>
<p t="2229550" d="4120">Do you know what? I don&#39;t care.
I don&#39;t need to know that.</p>
<p t="2233670" d="2610">It doesn&#39;t need to be in
my brain all the time.</p>
<p t="2236280" d="2020">I don&#39;t need it on speed recall.</p>
<p t="2238300" d="1730">I can look that shit up.</p>
<p t="2240030" d="2180">Most of technology is like that.</p>
<p t="2242210" d="2120">If you just have the rough outline</p>
<p t="2244330" d="3350">of a concept existing in the world,</p>
<p t="2247680" d="2290">you don&#39;t actually need to
internalize all that content</p>
<p t="2249970" d="2410">and keep it in your working memory</p>
<p t="2252380" d="1503">on a day to day basis.</p>
<p t="2256445" d="2755">Now, the second part of this is,</p>
<p t="2259200" d="2720">one thing is we want to
make it easy to learn.</p>
<p t="2261920" d="3216">We want to make it easy to learn</p>
<p t="2265136" d="2774">so that a bootcamp of three
months can be sufficient.</p>
<p t="2267910" d="1010">Not even a bootcamp.</p>
<p t="2268920" d="2060">A Rails tutorial for
someone who is interested</p>
<p t="2270980" d="2540">and reading on nights, or whatever,</p>
<p t="2273520" d="2451">could be sufficient for someone to learn</p>
<p t="2275971" d="2409">just the bare minimum so
that they can get started.</p>
<p t="2278380" d="1640">Because the corollary of that is</p>
<p t="2280020" d="1980">we also make it easier to launch.</p>
<p t="2282000" d="1210">The fewer concepts that you need</p>
<p t="2283210" d="2000">to operate and juggle to learn,</p>
<p t="2285210" d="1610">is also the fewer concepts that you need</p>
<p t="2286820" d="2620">to operate and juggle to launch.</p>
<p t="2289440" d="4073">Now, I think a great
example of this is Twitter.</p>
<p t="2294480" d="2580">Twitter was launched on Ruby on Rails</p>
<p t="2297060" d="1900">by a bunch of people who,</p>
<p t="2298960" d="2290">by all accounts of what happened later,</p>
<p t="2301250" d="2233">had no fuckin&#39; clue what they were doing.</p>
<p t="2305350" d="2550">No clue. Not on the business side.</p>
<p t="2307900" d="3890">Not on the conceptual side.
Not on the technical side.</p>
<p t="2311790" d="2993">Not on the architecture side. No clue.</p>
<p t="2316040" d="5000">If such a motley crew of
characters can come up with Twitter</p>
<p t="2321640" d="2170">and sustain it to this day,</p>
<p t="2323810" d="2590">where we can all look at an application</p>
<p t="2326400" d="3217">that had its root in
Ruby on Rails and think,</p>
<p t="2329617" d="1776">&quot;This might be how it ends.</p>
<p t="2332577" d="2670">&quot;The nuclear apocalypse
might come tomorrow</p>
<p t="2335247" d="3191">&quot;because of the thing we helped create.&quot;</p>
<p t="2338438" d="833">(laughter)</p>
<p t="2339271" d="3792">Now, that is a deep sense of
satisfaction in the world.</p>
<p t="2344935" d="3915">A sense of real imprint on the probability</p>
<p t="2348850" d="2640">of the continuation of our species.</p>
<p t="2351490" d="2170">Now, not a lot of people</p>
<p t="2353660" d="1950">get to take such a pride in their work.</p>
<p t="2358087" d="1883">The funny thing with Twitter, of course,</p>
<p t="2359970" d="2530">is that it&#39;s sort of the most</p>
<p t="2364008" d="4002">iconic case of someone
starting on Ruby on Rails,</p>
<p t="2368010" d="3840">then hitting some
problems, some fail whales,</p>
<p t="2371850" d="4040">that they took an extraordinary
amount of time to fix,</p>
<p t="2375890" d="1820">and then when they fixed it,</p>
<p t="2377710" d="2860">a lot of tales were spun
of whose fault that was,</p>
<p t="2380570" d="2000">because surely it was not the motley crew</p>
<p t="2382570" d="2450">of people who worked on it, right?</p>
<p t="2385020" d="1440">There&#39;s much easier solutions.</p>
<p t="2386460" d="2926">It was the color of the
LEGO blocks. Clearly.</p>
<p t="2389386" d="2644">They were just the wrong color.</p>
<p t="2392030" d="1310">They didn&#39;t fit together just right</p>
<p t="2393340" d="2250">for the persons who were building it.</p>
<p t="2395590" d="3693">And yet Twitter, supposedly,</p>
<p t="2400320" d="3860">I think moved on from Ruby on Rails</p>
<p t="2404180" d="1870">like seven, eight years ago or something</p>
<p t="2406050" d="3460">and moved to a wonderful,
efficient Java platform.</p>
<p t="2409510" d="1930">And then in about seven or eight years,</p>
<p t="2411440" d="2040">nothing fucking happened.</p>
<p t="2413480" d="2400">The entire application is exactly the same</p>
<p t="2415880" d="3561">as the one they arrived at
through the experimentation</p>
<p t="2419441" d="3299">of the early days with Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p t="2422740" d="4003">Which I think goes exactly to
that point of easy to launch.</p>
<p t="2427770" d="2360">When Twitter first got started,</p>
<p t="2430130" d="3580">it was this thing where
you would SMS your friends</p>
<p t="2433710" d="2710">such that they knew which bar you were at.</p>
<p t="2436420" d="2680">They didn&#39;t have the concept
that this was, at one point,</p>
<p t="2439100" d="5000">going to be the siren
of our impending doom.</p>
<p t="2446520" d="1710">They didn&#39;t architect it in such a way</p>
<p t="2448230" d="2850">that you&#39;d have the
president send tweets out</p>
<p t="2451080" d="3850">to 50 million people, and
then be spread further still.</p>
<p t="2454930" d="2120">They didn&#39;t know what they were doing.</p>
<p t="2457050" d="1300">They needed low barriers of entry</p>
<p t="2458350" d="3350">such that a few people who
barely knew what they were doing</p>
<p t="2461700" d="2320">could come up with a
concept, iterate on it,</p>
<p t="2464020" d="1400">and get to the point like, okay,</p>
<p t="2465420" d="1450">I guess this thing is good enough now.</p>
<p t="2466870" d="2210">Let&#39;s pour the concrete and change nothing</p>
<p t="2469080" d="1390">for the next seven or eight years</p>
<p t="2470470" d="1780">while we make it fast and performant.</p>
<p t="2472250" d="3770">That&#39;s a success story.
A huge success story.</p>
<p t="2476020" d="1920">Because if you were thinking, like,</p>
<p t="2477940" d="1770">hey, what if they had
applied the techniques</p>
<p t="2479710" d="3564">that they&#39;re currently using
to operate the site on day one?</p>
<p t="2483274" d="2806">What if they used the
tools and the techniques</p>
<p t="2486080" d="3690">that they&#39;re now using, the
team sizes that they now have,</p>
<p t="2489770" d="1300">to build the initial version</p>
<p t="2491070" d="2700">and figure out what
this thing actually was.</p>
<p t="2493770" d="1440">They would never have
fucking figured that out.</p>
<p t="2495210" d="2430">It would have been a concrete version</p>
<p t="2497640" d="2256">of like, let me send an SMS to friends</p>
<p t="2499896" d="2424">so that they know which bar I&#39;m at.</p>
<p t="2502320" d="2873">Maybe that&#39;s nice, but it&#39;s not Twitter.</p>
<p t="2510150" d="3260">And I think the summary of that point is</p>
<p t="2514650" d="3120">if we want to have a broader set of people</p>
<p t="2517770" d="2830">be involved in technology,</p>
<p t="2520600" d="2430">we need to reduce the barriers of entry</p>
<p t="2523030" d="3010">for access to that technology.</p>
<p t="2526040" d="3170">Because it&#39;s one thing to
be a user of technology,</p>
<p t="2529210" d="1814">and we can complain,</p>
<p t="2531024" d="1906">and there&#39;s plenty of users of Twitter,</p>
<p t="2532930" d="3220">and they certainly use
that service to complain.</p>
<p t="2536150" d="4340">It&#39;s something else to be an
actual maker of technology</p>
<p t="2540490" d="4830">and have the tools of
production in your own hands,</p>
<p t="2545320" d="1880">and have an actual chance</p>
<p t="2547200" d="2640">of charting out new and
alternative futures.</p>
<p t="2549840" d="3100">And unless we widen the pool of people</p>
<p t="2552940" d="1930">who will have access to those tools</p>
<p t="2554870" d="1980">and who are working on that future,</p>
<p t="2556850" d="2480">we&#39;re gonna get the future of tomorrow</p>
<p t="2559330" d="2650">in the past of yesterday.</p>
<p t="2561980" d="2020">I think that&#39;s how the math went.</p>
<p t="2565212" d="2518">Then we cannot expect different outcomes</p>
<p t="2567730" d="3730">if we apply the same people
to the same problems.</p>
<p t="2571460" d="2630">If we apply the same
people within the same</p>
<p t="2574090" d="3440">confines and constraints
of both technical systems,</p>
<p t="2577530" d="3680">and economic systems, and
all sorts of other systems...</p>
<p t="2581210" d="2210">We need a broader base.</p>
<p t="2583420" d="4290">Otherwise we&#39;re not gonna get
a broader set of solutions.</p>
<p t="2587710" d="5000">Now, some of this feels like
I&#39;m rehashing old battles here.</p>
<p t="2594319" d="2671">And it is, because that&#39;s kind of fun.</p>
<p t="2596990" d="3920">But it&#39;s also really
not the important part.</p>
<p t="2600910" d="1500">The important part is not to look like,</p>
<p t="2602410" d="1550">oh what did Twitter user do,</p>
<p t="2603960" d="3190">or oh, people used to think ORMs</p>
<p t="2607150" d="3130">couldn&#39;t do this, that, or
the other thing, ha ha ha.</p>
<p t="2610280" d="4220">It&#39;s more the sense that
we should use history,</p>
<p t="2614500" d="3480">we should use the past,
to inform the present,</p>
<p t="2617980" d="1140">and the future.</p>
<p t="2619120" d="2240">That we should look back over this arc</p>
<p t="2621360" d="2780">of 20 years of conceptual compression,</p>
<p t="2624140" d="2490">and the advances that we&#39;ve made,</p>
<p t="2626630" d="2450">and ensure that at the very least,</p>
<p t="2629080" d="2040">we hold our goddamn ground.</p>
<p t="2631120" d="5000">We&#39;ve gotten to a great place
with information technology.</p>
<p t="2636430" d="4600">We&#39;ve lowered the barriers of
entry so much, it&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p t="2641030" d="1310">And it really is amazing when you</p>
<p t="2642340" d="1660">look over that 20 year period</p>
<p t="2644000" d="2160">and you look at the kinds of people,</p>
<p t="2646160" d="2053">and the resources that are required,</p>
<p t="2649090" d="1880">to launch something and
make something today.</p>
<p t="2650970" d="3450">Those two worlds look
quite very different.</p>
<p t="2654420" d="3553">And the one we have today, in
many ways, is so much better.</p>
<p t="2659070" d="2913">So that&#39;s worth protecting.
It&#39;s worth guarding.</p>
<p t="2663780" d="4150">What I see happening, though,
in large extents right now</p>
<p t="2667930" d="1513">is a lot of backsliding.</p>
<p t="2670360" d="3560">That we have these amazing
accomplishments and achievements</p>
<p t="2673920" d="2220">and we&#39;re letting them erode.</p>
<p t="2676140" d="2360">We&#39;re letting them sort of fall backwards.</p>
<p t="2678500" d="3200">That the industry at
large is currently focused</p>
<p t="2681700" d="3230">a lot on conceptual expansion.</p>
<p t="2684930" d="3130">We&#39;re introducing a
whole lot of new ideas,</p>
<p t="2688060" d="3430">which is great, in some sense,</p>
<p t="2691490" d="3190">but we&#39;re letting them
balloon, and bloat to the point</p>
<p t="2694680" d="5000">where it&#39;s so much harder to reason about</p>
<p t="2699680" d="2917">and feel confident about,
&quot;I can build a whole thing.&quot;</p>
<p t="2703750" d="4220">If I want to build a so-called
modern web application today,</p>
<p t="2707970" d="2380">how much stuff do I need to know?</p>
<p t="2710350" d="2910">How many concepts do I need to juggle</p>
<p t="2713260" d="1583">to be sort of on par?</p>
<p t="2715770" d="5000">If you look at the supposed
requirements today, 2018,</p>
<p t="2720980" d="4894">versus the supposed requirements
of let&#39;s say 2005, or 2008,</p>
<p t="2725874" d="2146">they&#39;re much worse.</p>
<p t="2728020" d="2800">We&#39;ve made the list of
things you ought to know,</p>
<p t="2730820" d="3153">or supposedly ought to know, much longer.</p>
<p t="2734920" d="2200">Which is part of raising those barriers.</p>
<p t="2737120" d="1910">Because yes, we&#39;ve still compressed--</p>
<p t="2739030" d="2910">The compressions we did are still there.</p>
<p t="2741940" d="3800">But if we impart the idea that</p>
<p t="2746750" d="1600">you also have to do all
of these other things,</p>
<p t="2748350" d="2103">it doesn&#39;t really help that much.</p>
<p t="2752270" d="3070">Which pushes you into two boundaries.</p>
<p t="2755340" d="1867">Either people just give up, and say like,</p>
<p t="2757207" d="2060">&quot;All right, this has just
gotten too complex for me.</p>
<p t="2759267" d="2710">&quot;I have to know what this SPA thing is.</p>
<p t="2761977" d="2110">&quot;I have to know what this
microservices thing is.</p>
<p t="2764087" d="1930">&quot;I have to build a native app.</p>
<p t="2766017" d="933">&quot;I have to...</p>
<p t="2768467" d="1420">&quot;That&#39;s not for me.
Technology is not for me.</p>
<p t="2769887" d="1787">&quot;This is too complicated.&quot;</p>
<p t="2771674" d="1563">Or people go the other
direction, which is like,</p>
<p t="2773237" d="2251">&quot;I should just specialize.</p>
<p t="2775488" d="1539">&quot;I&#39;ll just pick one thing</p>
<p t="2777027" d="3550">&quot;and I&#39;ll become the best
goddamned React expert there is.&quot;</p>
<p t="2781900" d="1590">Now I can&#39;t do anything on my own</p>
<p t="2783490" d="2360">because I just know this
one part of the puzzle,</p>
<p t="2785850" d="2490">but at least I can get
hired by a big company</p>
<p t="2788340" d="3653">making big software. Yay.</p>
<p t="2794230" d="1350">That is a form of progress.</p>
<p t="2796890" d="1440">It&#39;s just not the kind of progress</p>
<p t="2798330" d="2000">that I&#39;m particularly excited about,</p>
<p t="2800330" d="2640">and not the kind of
progress that I want you</p>
<p t="2802970" d="1160">to be excited about.</p>
<p t="2804130" d="1530">Now, you have to be careful, of course.</p>
<p t="2805660" d="2330">There&#39;s a lot of nostalgia about this,</p>
<p t="2807990" d="3127">and I&#39;m certainly not immune
to the charge of thinking like,</p>
<p t="2811117" d="1700">&quot;Oh yeah, you like 2005,</p>
<p t="2812817" d="2210">&quot;because that was sort of
like when Rails came out,</p>
<p t="2815027" d="2010">&quot;and there was a lot
of energy around that.</p>
<p t="2817037" d="2880">&quot;And now it&#39;s just nostalgia,
and we&#39;re just hearkening back</p>
<p t="2819917" d="3090">&quot;and wishing that yesterday still existed,</p>
<p t="2823007" d="2753">&quot;and it just doesn&#39;t, because
the requirements changed.&quot;</p>
<p t="2825760" d="1510">And there&#39;s truth to that.</p>
<p t="2827270" d="3013">But it&#39;s sort of not the whole picture.</p>
<p t="2834040" d="3740">The problem is when we
sort of set a new baseline.</p>
<p t="2837780" d="4110">It&#39;s not that new ideas aren&#39;t good.</p>
<p t="2841890" d="2730">It&#39;s that we have to be cognizant</p>
<p t="2844620" d="2320">of what it is that we&#39;re doing,
how we&#39;re approaching it,</p>
<p t="2846940" d="2210">such that we don&#39;t end
up with this new baseline</p>
<p t="2849150" d="3590">that is so much higher in
terms of the complexity,</p>
<p t="2852740" d="4550">in terms of who it is we
allow to make new applications</p>
<p t="2857290" d="2113">that can have an impact on the world,</p>
<p t="2860453" d="2127">that we cut that off.</p>
<p t="2862580" d="2170">We had these extraordinary gains.</p>
<p t="2864750" d="2488">We made all these monumental</p>
<p t="2867238" d="2912">leaps of conceptual compression.</p>
<p t="2870150" d="3110">And if we wash all that
away by introducing</p>
<p t="2873260" d="3810">just an avalanche of new
uncompressed concepts,</p>
<p t="2877070" d="2820">and don&#39;t work on
compressing those concepts,</p>
<p t="2879890" d="3110">and just work on finding
more and new ones,</p>
<p t="2883000" d="913">we&#39;re gonna lose.</p>
<p t="2885680" d="890">And I think it&#39;s kind of--</p>
<p t="2886570" d="4720">It&#39;s a loss that you don&#39;t
sense until it&#39;s too late.</p>
<p t="2891290" d="3240">That&#39;s what sort of this look back,</p>
<p t="2894530" d="5000">this idea of letting history
inform us, can help us with,</p>
<p t="2899645" d="2575">be instructive, comparative.</p>
<p t="2902220" d="3050">How was it to develop things in 1995,</p>
<p t="2905270" d="3370">versus 2005, versus 2015?</p>
<p t="2908640" d="980">How does the curve look?</p>
<p t="2909620" d="4280">In which areas were we
most welcoming, most open,</p>
<p t="2913900" d="4293">most approachable, and
can we guard those things?</p>
<p t="2919330" d="2300">Because if we don&#39;t guard these things,</p>
<p t="2921630" d="4440">I&#39;m pretty sure the WS-Deathstar
is going to get rebuilt.</p>
<p t="2926070" d="4993">We defeated this monstrosity
back in the early 2000s.</p>
<p t="2932120" d="2300">WS-Deathstar, which was, I think,</p>
<p t="2934420" d="2513">my first presentation on Rails,</p>
<p t="2937845" d="3425">ranted against this notion
that was going on at the time,</p>
<p t="2941270" d="3040">which was this proliferation of</p>
<p t="2945870" d="4080">crazily complicated and
convoluted protocols</p>
<p t="2949950" d="2733">for how web services
could talk to each other.</p>
<p t="2953920" d="2070">And you had like 45 standards,</p>
<p t="2955990" d="2190">and they were getting
pushed by IBM, and Sun,</p>
<p t="2958180" d="1780">and whatever, this was the future.</p>
<p t="2959960" d="3500">And it was an incompatible,
overly complex,</p>
<p t="2963460" d="3510">complete utter mess that
bred specialization,</p>
<p t="2966970" d="2480">and it bred all the ills
that I&#39;ve been talking about.</p>
<p t="2969450" d="3833">And it represented one possible future.</p>
<p t="2974799" d="2791">That this was the way and the
direction that web services,</p>
<p t="2977590" d="2770">and web sites were going to go,</p>
<p t="2980360" d="4580">in this complicated, overly
specialized sort of way.</p>
<p t="2984940" d="4473">Then the rebels mounted an attack.</p>
<p t="2990770" d="3520">And that attack took forms in
a lot of disjointed things.</p>
<p t="2994290" d="2140">It wasn&#39;t necessarily a concerted effort.</p>
<p t="2996430" d="3020">It was things like rediscovering REST,</p>
<p t="2999450" d="3583">the basic architectural
principles of the web.</p>
<p t="3004180" d="1270">Figuring out that, you know what,</p>
<p t="3005450" d="3170">XML is actually not that great
and we can just use JSON.</p>
<p t="3008620" d="2360">Like, it doesn&#39;t matter,
any of these specialization,</p>
<p t="3010980" d="2151">and these attributes, and whatever,</p>
<p t="3013131" d="1879">you can take that entire
ball of complicated wax</p>
<p t="3015010" d="3117">and just say, &quot;You know
what? It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;</p>
<p t="3018127" d="2866">Conceptual compression for sure.</p>
<p t="3022530" d="2540">We could take the whole
set of convoluted protocols</p>
<p t="3025070" d="2930">and basically just replace
them with things like WebHooks,</p>
<p t="3028000" d="1187">which basically just says,</p>
<p t="3029187" d="1900">&quot;Hey, you know what? I&#39;m
just gonna send you some JSON</p>
<p t="3031087" d="2313">&quot;to this URL when you&#39;re done.&quot;</p>
<p t="3033400" d="2133">You hardly even need a spec for that.</p>
<p t="3036460" d="3913">Again, conceptual, not just
compression, but counterattack.</p>
<p t="3041270" d="2780">And I think we are at that point</p>
<p t="3044050" d="3060">with a lot of the concepts
we&#39;re currently wrestling with</p>
<p t="3047110" d="3200">in the industry, that
it can go either way.</p>
<p t="3050310" d="3230">We can either continue to
rebuild the Death Star,</p>
<p t="3053540" d="2120">and get more complicated,
and more convoluted,</p>
<p t="3055660" d="1640">and more specialized,</p>
<p t="3057300" d="2763">or we can mount a counterattack, again.</p>
<p t="3061448" d="1432">That&#39;s where, again,</p>
<p t="3062880" d="1880">you have to be careful with
this notion of nostalgia</p>
<p t="3064760" d="2060">because it&#39;s not that we want to go back</p>
<p t="3066820" d="3070">and think like, &quot;Oh, these
things didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p>
<p t="3069890" d="3300">Native didn&#39;t happen, or
mobile phones didn&#39;t happen,</p>
<p t="3073190" d="1680">or any of these things didn&#39;t happen.</p>
<p t="3074870" d="3364">It&#39;s that you want to take
those things and embrace them</p>
<p t="3078234" d="4326">with the principles that
we applied in the past.</p>
<p t="3082560" d="3230">Not the actual past, but
the lessons that we learned.</p>
<p t="3085790" d="3280">Anyway, that&#39;s some of the backsliding</p>
<p t="3089070" d="1140">that&#39;s currently going on.</p>
<p t="3090210" d="3010">Some of these lessons that
we learned in our community</p>
<p t="3093220" d="2220">are sort of evaporating.</p>
<p t="3095440" d="2130">And I think that that&#39;s a damn shame.</p>
<p t="3097570" d="2659">Because I think what happens when</p>
<p t="3100229" d="2431">we get into these deep dives</p>
<p t="3102660" d="2110">of complexity and specialization is,</p>
<p t="3104770" d="3342">in some part, it contributes to this idea</p>
<p t="3108112" d="4338">of being alienated from
the product of our labor.</p>
<p t="3112450" d="3730">When the product of our labor
and the things that we make</p>
<p t="3116180" d="1440">become less and less tangible,</p>
<p t="3117620" d="4630">and your specific input on it
becomes more and more diffused</p>
<p t="3122250" d="1300">because you&#39;re just working on</p>
<p t="3123550" d="2020">one isolated little box of it,</p>
<p t="3125570" d="2290">it becomes so much easier, sort of,</p>
<p t="3127860" d="1640">to lose your connection to that,</p>
<p t="3129500" d="1480">what you&#39;re actually working on,</p>
<p t="3130980" d="2543">and what that impact on
the world actually is.</p>
<p t="3134603" d="3437">Harry Braverman has this
quote that I&#39;ve liked since</p>
<p t="3138040" d="5000">I&#39;ve started a very cursory
dive into Marxist literature.</p>
<p t="3144600" d="3140">It&#39;s an interesting dive in itself</p>
<p t="3147740" d="1890">because there&#39;s certainly
a lot of history there,</p>
<p t="3149630" d="3280">and some bad outcomes.</p>
<p t="3152910" d="2680">But just because you don&#39;t
like someone&#39;s prescriptions</p>
<p t="3155590" d="2140">of what you should do
about certain problems</p>
<p t="3157730" d="2800">doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t
recognize the insights</p>
<p t="3160530" d="1910">that their diagnosis brings.</p>
<p t="3162440" d="2490">And I think, as of right now,</p>
<p t="3164930" d="3550">the diagnosis from Marxist literature</p>
<p t="3168480" d="2973">is incredibly timely for our time.</p>
<p t="3173730" d="2723">Harry was writing in the &#39;70s here.</p>
<p t="3178650" d="2570">The red shirt in the back. Thank you.</p>
<p t="3181220" d="1647">(laughter)</p>
<p t="3182867" d="4800">&quot;While the social division
of labor subdivides society,</p>
<p t="3187667" d="2950">&quot;the detailed division of
labor subdivides humans.</p>
<p t="3190617" d="2580">&quot;And while the subdivision
of society may enhance</p>
<p t="3193197" d="1650">&quot;the individual and the species,</p>
<p t="3194847" d="1960">&quot;the subdivision of the individual,</p>
<p t="3196807" d="1930">&quot;when carried on without regard</p>
<p t="3198737" d="2650">&quot;to human capabilities and needs</p>
<p t="3201387" d="3173">&quot;is a crime against the
person and humanity.&quot;</p>
<p t="3204560" d="2640">Now, the social division
of labor refers to</p>
<p t="3207200" d="2670">the notion that we don&#39;t all know how to</p>
<p t="3209870" d="2250">make shoes, and be plumbers, and whatever,</p>
<p t="3212120" d="3530">that there are these broad
industries that we fall into,</p>
<p t="3215650" d="1970">versus the detailed division of labor</p>
<p t="3217620" d="2930">is when you take something like, oh,</p>
<p t="3220550" d="2540">programmer can build (mumbling) system,</p>
<p t="3223090" d="5000">and relegates it to, oh, spec
specialist on the WS-Deathstar</p>
<p t="3230130" d="3330">spec number 42 regarding transactions.</p>
<p t="3233460" d="3060">That is a detailed division of labor</p>
<p t="3236520" d="2710">that alienates us from the
product of our own work</p>
<p t="3239230" d="2770">and makes it harder for us to sort of</p>
<p t="3242000" d="2170">invite it and broaden the base.</p>
<p t="3244170" d="4980">Now, the more alienated we get</p>
<p t="3249150" d="2230">from the product of our labor,</p>
<p t="3251380" d="3503">the easier it becomes to
commit software iatrogenics.</p>
<p t="3256450" d="4360">Iatrogenics is this concept from medicine,</p>
<p t="3260810" d="3283">doctors trying to do well
ending up harming the patient.</p>
<p t="3266770" d="1930">Nassim Taleb has written
a bunch about this</p>
<p t="3268700" d="3480">and how iatrogenics applies to
a bunch of other professions,</p>
<p t="3272180" d="2360">including economics and so forth,</p>
<p t="3274540" d="3740">where supposedly specialized, wise people</p>
<p t="3278280" d="3260">end up harming their patients,
and their constituents.</p>
<p t="3281540" d="4405">I think software right
now is at its low point</p>
<p t="3285945" d="2435">in that regard.</p>
<p t="3288380" d="2230">Software has never harmed more people</p>
<p t="3290610" d="1830">than it does right now.</p>
<p t="3292440" d="2470">It&#39;s also never helped more
people than it does right now.</p>
<p t="3294910" d="3420">But these two things
aren&#39;t invariably linked.</p>
<p t="3298330" d="1190">We can help a lot of people</p>
<p t="3299520" d="2140">without also harming a lot of people.</p>
<p t="3301660" d="890">And I think the</p>
<p t="3304830" d="4010">sort of lack of acceptance
of that responsibility</p>
<p t="3308840" d="2260">that we as software developers have,</p>
<p t="3311100" d="5000">to not harm the patient, is minuscule,</p>
<p t="3316570" d="3130">and relegated to sort
of a small subset corner</p>
<p t="3319700" d="2070">that doesn&#39;t seem like it applies directly</p>
<p t="3321770" d="1830">to what it is that we do everyday,</p>
<p t="3323600" d="1800">when it&#39;s at the absolute core</p>
<p t="3325400" d="2040">of what it is that we do everyday.</p>
<p t="3327440" d="1720">And I think that these things are linked.</p>
<p t="3329160" d="2300">The more specialized you are,</p>
<p t="3331460" d="2488">the more deep and narrow you are,</p>
<p t="3333948" d="1822">the stronger are your blinders,</p>
<p t="3335770" d="2300">the harder it is to
see the bigger picture,</p>
<p t="3338070" d="4450">and the easier it is to defend
for yourself and for others</p>
<p t="3342520" d="1450">what it is that you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p t="3345960" d="3100">Now, this plays in particularly, I think,</p>
<p t="3349060" d="3343">in our time right now
because we&#39;ve been colonized.</p>
<p t="3353250" d="2920">The new world of the Internet</p>
<p t="3356170" d="2630">has been colonized by a small set</p>
<p t="3358800" d="2483">of very successful conquistadors.</p>
<p t="3362440" d="5000">And they&#39;re taking this
promise, this new world,</p>
<p t="3367640" d="2830">and turning it into
kind of a shitty place.</p>
<p t="3370470" d="3010">Now they&#39;re getting fabulously
wealthy in the process</p>
<p t="3373480" d="3883">by extracting our attention, our privacy,</p>
<p t="3378880" d="2460">through monopolies and other forms,</p>
<p t="3381340" d="4460">and that&#39;s bringing, oh, some
progress in some regards.</p>
<p t="3385800" d="3560">But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve
fully understood the trade,</p>
<p t="3389360" d="3990">that the conquistadors
showed up with cheap mirrors</p>
<p t="3393350" d="4469">and shitty combs, and
traded us our most valuable</p>
<p t="3397819" d="1924">aspects of humanity.</p>
<p t="3400730" d="4673">And I think that trade needs a counter.</p>
<p t="3406340" d="2110">That it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</p>
<p t="3408450" d="1200">And again, history is an</p>
<p t="3412390" d="3540">instructive guide that it
didn&#39;t used to be this way.</p>
<p t="3415930" d="1850">The internet didn&#39;t used to be colonized</p>
<p t="3417780" d="1580">in the way that it is now.</p>
<p t="3419360" d="2270">Yes, in some forms,
actually, it was colonized</p>
<p t="3421630" d="4080">through Prodigy, and AOL, and
other portals at the time.</p>
<p t="3425710" d="3190">But then we had sort of a
glorious time in the middle</p>
<p t="3428900" d="2740">where there were far more options,</p>
<p t="3431640" d="1590">there was far more competition,</p>
<p t="3433230" d="2920">and power, and wealth, in some regards,</p>
<p t="3436150" d="3943">was not concentrated in the
hands of this little elite.</p>
<p t="3440970" d="2560">Now, this is all
happening in our backyard.</p>
<p t="3443530" d="3093">This is not some external
thing that&#39;s going on.</p>
<p t="3447920" d="1410">This is us. This is our profession.</p>
<p t="3449330" d="1670">This is what it&#39;s being used for.</p>
<p t="3451000" d="4583">We have a responsibility
to do something about that.</p>
<p t="3459290" d="3061">Just to the point, Piketty,</p>
<p t="3462351" d="2589">author who put out this very long book</p>

<p t="3490760" d="3153">the rest of what was of
that industry before it.</p>
<p t="3495080" d="3540">That&#39;s not good for anyone,</p>
<p t="3498620" d="2200">other than perhaps the
people who happen to own</p>
<p t="3500820" d="2746">Facebook, and Google,
and their shareholders.</p>
<p t="3503566" d="1784">Like, that&#39;s a regression for the world</p>
<p t="3505350" d="3393">that we&#39;re concentrating wealth
and industry in this form.</p>
<p t="3509992" d="3128">And again, we have a responsibility</p>
<p t="3513120" d="1430">to do something about that.</p>
<p t="3514550" d="2230">And I think it simply will not do</p>
<p t="3516780" d="2940">that we, as the implementers
of these visions,</p>
<p t="3519720" d="5000">and these systems, just close
our eyes, close our ears,</p>
<p t="3525290" d="2410">and stop talking about it.</p>
<p t="3527700" d="1340">These easiest thing we can do</p>
<p t="3529040" d="2810">is just to step back, dive
into our specializations,</p>
<p t="3531850" d="3167">dive into our technology,
and say, &quot;No, no.</p>
<p t="3535017" d="1320">&quot;That&#39;s it. That&#39;s just my birth.</p>
<p t="3536337" d="1790">&quot;That&#39;s where I&#39;m at.&quot;</p>
<p t="3539690" d="2830">So when I look at what my mission is,</p>
<p t="3542520" d="1720">what our mission should be,</p>
<p t="3544240" d="5000">the mission that I want
to inspire people to join,</p>
<p t="3549280" d="2700">is the idea of liberating the best ideas.</p>
<p t="3551980" d="3031">So, when Rails first got started,</p>
<p t="3555011" d="3159">I had some choice words,
let&#39;s call them that,</p>
<p t="3558170" d="2711">for the Java and the J2e community.</p>
<p t="3560881" d="2929">Those choice words were
not based on the fact</p>
<p t="3563810" d="1450">that there weren&#39;t good ideas.</p>
<p t="3565260" d="1300">In fact, they were based on the fact that</p>
<p t="3566560" d="2740">there were good ideas, lots of them,</p>
<p t="3569300" d="4860">but they were trapped inside
these conceptual cages.</p>
<p t="3577800" d="1570">And that we could open those cages,</p>
<p t="3579370" d="1997">and we could take those
wonderful concepts out,</p>
<p t="3581367" d="1893">and we could distribute them more widely</p>
<p t="3583260" d="2439">such that more people could use these</p>
<p t="3585699" d="2331">level of progress, and patterns,</p>
<p t="3588030" d="2963">and ideas for how to
build information systems,</p>
<p t="3591846" d="1834">but that it had to be liberated.</p>
<p t="3593680" d="1790">That the ideas trapped inside these cages</p>
<p t="3595470" d="2783">were only accessible to a select few.</p>
<p t="3599330" d="1640">Once we&#39;ve taken these best ideas out--</p>
<p t="3600970" d="1820">And I want to take those best ideas out</p>
<p t="3602790" d="4080">through conceptual compression,
leaky abstractions,</p>
<p t="3606870" d="2010">these techniques that I&#39;ve discussed--</p>
<p t="3608880" d="2113">then we can arm the rebels.</p>
<p t="3613270" d="3630">And when we arm the rebels,</p>
<p t="3616900" d="4730">we get a chance, at least
a chance, to fight back.</p>
<p t="3621630" d="1740">Fight back on the technical level.</p>
<p t="3623370" d="2160">Fight back on the societal level.</p>
<p t="3625530" d="2670">Fight back on the economic level.</p>
<p t="3628200" d="5000">Fight back, and return to a
notion of things that worked,</p>
<p t="3633700" d="1700">and reject the things that didn&#39;t.</p>
<p t="3636500" d="3320">Because software is eating the world.</p>
<p t="3639820" d="3110">There&#39;s no denying that, and
we cannot turn that clock back.</p>
<p t="3642930" d="2780">It&#39;s not like that&#39;s going to stop.</p>
<p t="3645710" d="2693">But who&#39;s writing that software? You are.</p>
<p t="3650447" d="4016">If you&#39;re writing that software
that is eating the world,</p>
<p t="3655870" d="4207">how do you not have a moral
and ethical obligation</p>
<p t="3660077" d="2243">to steer that?</p>
<p t="3662320" d="873">Of course you do.</p>
<p t="3664620" d="3580">And being blind to that,
it&#39;s not gonna help us.</p>
<p t="3668200" d="2890">It&#39;s just gonna delay the inevitable.</p>
<p t="3671090" d="3673">So, let&#39;s do this work.</p>
<p t="3675880" d="2800">Let&#39;s continue to compress the concepts</p>
<p t="3678680" d="3333">that are worth keeping,
reject the ones that aren&#39;t,</p>
<p t="3683030" d="3980">broaden the base of people
who can actually have</p>
<p t="3687010" d="2843">a chance to write this software
that&#39;s eating the world,</p>
<p t="3690730" d="2830">such that the software that we end up with</p>
<p t="3693560" d="2260">is software the benefits the world.</p>
<p t="3695820" d="1000">Thank you very much.</p>
<p t="3698246" d="2250">(applause)</p>
